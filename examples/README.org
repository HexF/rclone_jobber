* Example scripts use environment variables for \"$path\"
The files in this directory are examples used by rclone_jobber_tutorial.org.
The example scripts have path variables preceded by $ e.g.
: source="$HOME/test_rclone_data"
: dest="$usb/test_rclone_backup"

You can set your system's environment variables, or you can manually replace occurrences of $variable with your system's paths.

The example scripts use the following environment path variables:
- HOME
- USER
- rclone_jobber
- usb
- remote
