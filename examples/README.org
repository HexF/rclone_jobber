The files in this directory are examples used in rclone_jobber_tutorial.org

The example scripts place environment path variables inside "${}" e.g.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    source="${HOME}/test_rclone_data"
    dest="${USB}/test_rclone_backup"
    options="--filter-from=${rclone_jobber}/examples/filter_rules --checksum"
#+END_EXAMPLE
That way you can run the examples scripts with a minimum of typing.
Follow the tutorial to see how that works.

The example scripts use these environment path variables:
- HOME
- USER
- rclone_jobber
- USB
- remote

You can set your system's environment variables, or you can manually replace occurrences of "${}" with your system's paths.
Your production backup scripts will have different paths than the examples.
