rclone_jobber is a pre-written script, which means it has the best of both worlds:
- Like a backup tool, rclone_jobber is already developed, documented, and tested.
  Only the job files need to be written, tested, and scheduled.
  rclone_jobber.sh has been tested on Linux, and should also run on macOS and [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about][Windows 10 wsl]].
- because it is a script, rclone_jobber is easily customized.

Both rclone and rclone_jobber.sh are command line tools.
